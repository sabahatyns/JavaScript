// like this console.log(ageyear(5)) user can just add his age tio know the age year, he dont need to know what ageyear function is 
//this is called abstraction- not showing the complexity for user

//FACTORY FUNCTIONS
// if we want to create two users we need  to write same code again again that is why we use afctory function to prevent this

// if both key and value are same like both firstName parameter is same we can write it once
// like this 
function createuser(firstName, lastName, age) {
    const user = {
         firstName, 
         lastName,
         age,

 }
 //pass parameter when calling function
 console.log(createuser("Danial", "Younas", 5,))
 
 const userOne = createuser("Danial", "Younas", 5,)
 console.log (userOne.ageyearofuser())

 //The line ageyearofuser: [Function: ageyearofuser] appears when you print the entire user object because itâ€™s showing that ageyearofuser is a function, rather than executing it to show the result.

//To display the birth year, you need to specifically call userOne.ageyearofuser() as a function.
